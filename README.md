## Hi there 👋

I work at [Leapsome](https://www.leapsome.com/) and am helping to solve stuff related to AI/LLM engineering.

I volunteer as a teacher at [ReDI](https://www.redi-school.org/munich), and have a passion for teaching and psychology (that's my formal education 👨‍🏫).

### Past Roles

I worked at [parcelLab](https://github.com/parcelLab) and have helped solved stuff related to scalability/cost/performance, distributed systems, complex business configurations, and testing/correctness. I scaled their events, workflow, and notification system to a billion events a week.
